    "text": "BIOS 600 Fall 2024\n\n\nDue: Friday, August 23 at 11:59p\n\n\nName: YOUR NAME GOES HERE\n\n\n\nExercise 1:\nThis study would be considered observational rather than experimental. In an observational study, researchers observe and measure outcomes without manipulating the variables or assigning participants to different conditions. In this case, the researchers observed the eating behaviors and caloric intake of patients with different types of dementia without assigning them to any specific group or intervening in their behavior. The different patient types (without dementia, with AD, semantic dementia, and bvFTD) were pre-existing, and the researchers simply observed the outcomes.\n\n\nExercise 2:\nAround 750 calories. This is based on the center line in the box.\n\n\nExercise 3:\nPatients with behavioral-variant frontal temporal dementia (bvFTD) had the largest IQR. You can see this in the boxplot since the box is the largest.\n\nIQR: about 1600 - 1000 = 600 calories\nfirst quartile: 1000 calories\nthird quartile: about 1600 calories\n\nSide note about how to read boxplots: The distance between Q3 and Q1 is known as the interquartile range (IQR) and plays a major part in how long the whiskers extending from the box are. Each whisker extends to the furthest data point in each wing that is within 1.5 times the IQR. Any data point further than that distance is considered an outlier, and is marked with a dot.\n\n\nExercise 4:\nRight-skewed, because the top whisker extends much farther than the lower whisker, indicating that most of the values are centered around a lower value.\n\n\nExercise 5:\nLower HDIs are associated with higher prevalence of MSVI (indicated by the downward pattern of the points in the scatterplot).\n\n\nExercise 6:\nNigeria has the lowest HDI (about 0.5).\n\n\nExercise 7:\nIndia has higher prevelance of MSVI than might be expected given its HDI. We can tell because the point for India is so much higher (on the y-axis, aka the MSVI axis) than the general trend of the points.\n\n\nExercise 8:\nThis is reasonable, there is a quite clear downward trend between HDI and MSVI.\n\n\nExercise 9:\n\nage: continuous\nrace: nominal\nbody-mass index: continuous\neosinophil count: continuous\n\n\n\nExercise 10:\nWith an experimental study, researchers can make causal statements about the results. There’s more control over confounding variables, and experimental studies can be easily replicated because the conditions are controlled or standardized.\n\n\nExercise 11:\nThe authors could make a grouped box-plot. One box per group.\n\n\nExercise 12:\nA scatterplot would be useful.\n\n\nExercise 13:\nThey could color the points according to the treatment group.\n\n\nExercise 14:\nThe probability that a randomly selected individual is assigned to placebo: 407/1204\n\n\nExercise 15:\nThe probability that a randomly selected individual is male:\n(138 + 124 + 146) /1204 = 408/1204\n\n\nExercise 16:\np(placebo) + p(male) - p(placebo and male) 407/1204 + 408/1204 - 138/1204 = 677/1204\n\n\nExercise 17:\nPlacebo and male\n138/1204\n\n\nExercise 18:\nAsian or not assigned to placebo\np(asian) + p(not placebo) - p(asian and not placebo)\n(50+54+50)/1204 + (399+398)/1204 - (54+50)/1204 = 847/1204\n\n\nExercise 19:\nThe formula to find the probability that an individual is white or male:\np(white) + p(male) - p(white and male)\nWe have p(white) and p(male) but we need p(white and male).\n\n\nExercise 20:\n\nScope: Reproducibility is more about verifying the correctness of the original analysis, while replicability is about testing the robustness of the findings across different settings.\nConditions: Reproducibility uses the same data and methods, whereas replicability often involves different data, samples, or methods.\nFocus: Reproducibility focuses on the precision and accuracy of the original study, while replicability focuses on the generalizability and reliability of the results across different scenarios."
