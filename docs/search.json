    "text": "BIOS 600 Fall 2024\n\n\nDue: Friday, August 23 at 11:59p\n\n\nName: YOUR NAME GOES HERE\n\n\n\nExercise 1:\nThis study would be considered observational rather than experimental. In an observational study, researchers observe and measure outcomes without manipulating the variables or assigning participants to different conditions. In this case, the researchers observed the eating behaviors and caloric intake of patients with different types of dementia without assigning them to any specific group or intervening in their behavior. The different patient types (without dementia, with AD, semantic dementia, and bvFTD) were pre-existing, and the researchers simply observed the outcomes.\n\n\nExercise 2:\nAround 750 calories. This is based on the center line in the box.\n\n\nExercise 3:\nPatients with behavioral-variant frontal temporal dementia (bvFTD) had the largest IQR. You can see this in the boxplot since the box is the largest.\n\nIQR: about 1600 - 1000 = 600 calories\nfirst quartile: 1000 calories\nthird quartile: about 1600 calories\n\nSide note about how to read boxplots: The distance between Q3 and Q1 is known as the interquartile range (IQR) and plays a major part in how long the whiskers extending from the box are. Each whisker extends to the furthest data point in each wing that is within 1.5 times the IQR. Any data point further than that distance is considered an outlier, and is marked with a dot.\n\n\nExercise 4:\nRight-skewed, because the top whisker extends much farther than the lower whisker, indicating that most of the values are centered around a lower value.\n\n\nExercise 5:\nLower HDIs are associated with higher prevalence of MSVI (indicated by the downward pattern of the points in the scatterplot).\n\n\nExercise 6:\nNigeria has the lowest HDI (about 0.5).\n\n\nExercise 7:\nIndia has higher prevelance of MSVI than might be expected given its HDI. We can tell because the point for India is so much higher (on the y-axis, aka the MSVI axis) than the general trend of the points.\n\n\nExercise 8:\nThis is reasonable, there is a quite clear downward trend between HDI and MSVI.\n\n\nExercise 9:\n\nage: continuous\nrace: nominal\nbody-mass index: continuous\neosinophil count: continuous\n\n\n\nExercise 10:\nWith an experimental study, researchers can make causal statements about the results. There’s more control over confounding variables, and experimental studies can be easily replicated because the conditions are controlled or standardized.\n\n\nExercise 11:\nThe authors could make a grouped box-plot. One box per group.\n\n\nExercise 12:\nA scatterplot would be useful.\n\n\nExercise 13:\nThey could color the points according to the treatment group.\n\n\nExercise 14:\nThe probability that a randomly selected individual is assigned to placebo: 407/1204\n\n\nExercise 15:\nThe probability that a randomly selected individual is male:\n(138 + 124 + 146) /1204 = 408/1204\n\n\nExercise 16:\np(placebo) + p(male) - p(placebo and male) 407/1204 + 408/1204 - 138/1204 = 677/1204\n\n\nExercise 17:\nPlacebo and male\n138/1204\n\n\nExercise 18:\nAsian or not assigned to placebo\np(asian) + p(not placebo) - p(asian and not placebo)\n(50+54+50)/1204 + (399+398)/1204 - (54+50)/1204 = 847/1204\n\n\nExercise 19:\nThe formula to find the probability that an individual is white or male:\np(white) + p(male) - p(white and male)\nWe have p(white) and p(male) but we need p(white and male).\n\n\nExercise 20:\n\nScope: Reproducibility is more about verifying the correctness of the original analysis, while replicability is about testing the robustness of the findings across different settings.\nConditions: Reproducibility uses the same data and methods, whereas replicability often involves different data, samples, or methods.\nFocus: Reproducibility focuses on the precision and accuracy of the original study, while replicability focuses on the generalizability and reliability of the results across different scenarios."

In this case, the number of trials (number of mice sampled) is not fixed, because the researcher is interested in continuing until 10 abnormal mice are found. This suggests that the scenario might be more appropriately modeled by a negative binomial distribution, which is used when the number of trials is not fixed, but instead, the experiment continues until a certain number of successes are observed.\n\nIndependence\n\nThe outcome of one trial (whether a mouse develops deficiencies) must be independent of the outcomes of other trials. If the mice are all exposed to the same conditions independently, this assumption could be satisfied. However, if there are interactions or dependencies between the mice (e.g., one mouse’s health affects another), this assumption might be violated.\n\nConstant Probability of Success\n\nThe probability of a mouse developing lung deficiencies (25 out of 100, or 0.25) is assumed to be constant across trials. This assumption might hold if the experimental conditions are consistent, and there is no change in the population or environmental factors that could affect this probability.\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3\nEvaluate whether the assumptions for a Poisson distribution are satisfied.\n\nWithin any interval, k may take on 1, 2, 3, …, infinity.\n\n\nThis does not hold, since there are a fixed number of students in each school.\n\n\nEach event occurs independently, both within the same interval, and between intervals\n\n\nEach case of measles should occur independently of the others. This means that one child developing measles should not directly influence whether another child in a different school district develops measles.\n\n\nThe average rate at which events occur in an interval, λ, is constant\n\n\nThe number of events (measles cases) should be proportional to the size of the population or the area (e.g., the size of the school district).\n\n\nTwo events cannot occur simultaneously\n\nThis is true. The Poisson distribution assumes that events (in this case, children developing measles) occur one at a time, not in clusters. This means that the likelihood of multiple children developing measles in the exact same instant is very low.\n\n\nExercise 4\nThe mean (2) is significantly greater than the variance (0.09). This violates the assumption of the Poisson distribution, where the mean and variance should be approximately equal.\nIt would not be appropriate to use a Poisson distribution to model the number of eggs laid by Adelie penguin breeding pairs because the key assumption that the mean equals the variance is violated. The variance is much smaller than the mean, suggesting that the data might be more consistent and less dispersed than what a Poisson distribution would predict.\n\n\nExercise 5\nWrite your answer to Exercise 5 here.\n\n\nExercise 6\nWrite your answer to Exercise 6 here.\n\n\nExercise 7\nWrite your answer to Exercise 7 here.\n\n\nExercise 8\nWrite your answer to Exercise 8 here.\n\n\nExercise 9\nWrite your answer to Exercise 9 here.\n\n\nExercise 10\nWrite your answer to Exercise 10 here."

This makes sense, because if one sibling has chicken pox, it may be more probable that the other sibling gets chicken pox, since we might assume they are sharing space in a home.\n\n\nExercise 6:\nDo Exercise 6 here. Feel free to write out any numerical calculations you are using, setting them apart using backticks in order to draw attention to them. For instance, (0.1 * 0.2)/(0.4*0.6 + (1-0.4)*0.3). When displaying your final answer, use an R chunk to evaluate the answer:\nWe want to find \\(P(B|A) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}\\)\n\\(P(A) = .5\\) \\(P(B) = .5\\) \\(P(A \\cap B) = .35\\)\nSo we have that the answer is (.35)/(.5).\n\n.35/.5\n\n[1] 0.7\n\n\n\n\nExercise 7:\nWe just calcuated that P(B|A) = 0.70.\n\\(P(B^C | A) = 1 - P(B|A)\\)\nSo, the answer is 1-0.70.\n\n1-0.70\n\n[1] 0.3\n\n\n\n\nExercise 8:\nWe want to find\n\\(P(B | A^C)\\)\nWe know that P(A^C) = 1-P(A) = 1-0.5 = 0.5\nNow, we use the law of total probability.\n\\(P(B) = P(B \\cap A) + P(B \\cap A^C)\\)\nSo we have that \\(0.5 = 0.35 + P(B \\cap A^C)\\) and \\(P(B \\cap A^C) = 0.5 - 0.35 = 0.15\\)\nNow, we apply Bayes’ Rule to find \\(P(B | A^C)\\).\n\\(P(B | A^C) = \\frac{P(B \\cap A^C)}{P(A^C)}\\)\n= 0.15/0.5\n\n0.15/0.5\n\n[1] 0.3\n\n\n\n\nExercise 9:\n\\(S\\) = severe WFNS score \\(B\\) = bad outcome at one year mark\n(10 + 30)/100 = 40/100\n\n40/100\n\n[1] 0.4\n\n\n\n\nExercise 10:\nSensitivity = true positive rate = \\(P(S|B)\\).\nUsing Bayes’ rule, we have \\(P(S|B) = \\frac{P(B|S)P(S)}{P(B)}\\)\nNow,\n\nP(bad outcome | severe score) = 30/40\nP(severe score) = 40/100\nP(bad outcome) = 40/100\n\nSo, \\(P(S|B)\\) = [(30/40)*(40/100)] / (40/100), which simplifies to\n\n30/40\n\n[1] 0.75\n\n\n\n\nExercise 11:\nSpecificity refers to the probability that a patient with a “good outcome” does not have a severe WFNS score. Mathematically, it is the probability that a patient has a non-severe WFNS score given that they have a good outcome: P(Non-Severe WFNS∣Good Outcome)P(Non-Severe WFNS∣Good Outcome)\nSo, we want: \\(P(\\text{non-severe score}| \\text{good outcome} ) = \\frac{P(\\text{good outcome} | \\text{non-severe score})P(\\text{non-severe score})}{P(\\text{good outcome})}\\)\n\nP(good outcome | non-severe score) = 50/60\nP(non-severe score)= 60/100\nP(good outcome) = 60/100\n\nThis simplifies to (50/60)*(60/100)/(60/100) = 50/60\n\n50/60\n\n[1] 0.8333333\n\n\nUsing Bayes’ Rule, we find that the specificity, or the probability that a patient with a good outcome has a non-severe WFNS score, is approximately 0.833, or 83.3%. This indicates that the WFNS score is fairly specific for identifying patients who will have a good outcome.\n\n\nExercise 12:\nTo calculate the Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of “high NDKA” as a diagnostic for bad outcomes, we first need to clarify that NPV is the probability that a patient does not have a bad outcome given that their NDKA level is low (i.e., the test result is negative). Given Information:\n\nSensitivity (True Positive Rate): 20% (P(High NDKA∣Bad Outcome)=0.2P(High NDKA∣Bad Outcome)=0.2)\nSpecificity (True Negative Rate): 90% (P(Low NDKA∣Good Outcome)=0.9P(Low NDKA∣Good Outcome)=0.9)\nPrevalence (P(Bad Outcome)): Not directly given, so we’ll assume it based on earlier data, where the prevalence was 40% (from the initial 100 patients, 40 had a bad outcome).\n\nNegative Predictive Value = P(good outcome | Low NDKA)\nUsing Bayes’ rule, this can be re-written as: [P(low NDKA | good outcome) * P(good outcome)] / P(low NDKA)\nP(low NDKA) = P(low NDKA | good)P(good) + P(low NDKA | bad) P(bad)\n\nP(low NDKA | good) = specificity = 0.9 (given)\nP(low NDKA | bad ) = 1- sensitivity = 1- P(B | A) = 1 - .20 = 0.80\n\nThis is by the law of total probability, which states that P(B|A) + P(B^C | A) = 1\n\nP(good outcome) = 0.60 from the question description\nP(bad outcome) = 0.40 from exercise 9\n\nP(low NDKA) = (0.90)*(0.60)+ (0.80)(0.40) = 0.86\n\n(0.90)*(0.60)+ (0.80)*(0.40)\n\n[1] 0.86\n\n\nThen, the NPV is [P(low NDKA | good)P(good)]/P(low NDKA)\n=\n\n(0.90)*(0.60)/0.86\n\n[1] 0.627907\n\n\nThe negative predictive value (NPV) of using “high NDKA” as a diagnostic for bad outcomes is approximately 0.628, or 62.8%. This means that if a patient has a low NDKA level, there is a 62.8% chance that they will not experience a bad outcome at the one-year mark.\n\n\nExercise 13:\nIf we are willing to accept a false positive rate of at most 10%, that means that we are willing to accept a Specificity as low as 90%, since False Positive Rate = 1 - specificity. The true positive rate is also known as the specificity. So, if we look at 90% on the x-axis, the corresponding specificity (or TPR) on the y-axis is about .35. So, we can attain aboug 35% true positive rate with that stipulation.\nNote: The ROC curve represents the trade-off between sensitivity (TPR) and specificity (related to FPR). Higher TPR values are better, but they usually come at the cost of increasing FPR, depending on the threshold set by the classifier.\n\n\nExercise 14:\nWe would rather use S100\\(\\beta\\), because the sensitivity levels are consistently higher compared to NDKA given a certain level of specificity.\n\n\nExercise 15:\n\ncdc &lt;- read.csv(\"https://karamccor.github.io/b6002/labs/data/cdc_cleaned.csv\")\n\n\n# Loading in tidyverse package...\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\nglimpse(cdc)\n\nRows: 50\nColumns: 17\n$ X                   &lt;int&gt; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15,…\n$ State               &lt;chr&gt; \"Alabama\", \"Alaska\", \"Arizona\", \"Arkansas\", \"Calif…\n$ Region              &lt;chr&gt; \"South\", \"West\", \"West\", \"South\", \"West\", \"West\", …\n$ HDI                 &lt;chr&gt; \"Bottom ten\", \"Middle\", \"Middle\", \"Bottom ten\", \"M…\n$ InfantMortalityRate &lt;dbl&gt; 8.7, 6.7, 6.1, 7.5, 4.3, 4.8, 4.8, 6.7, 6.1, 7.5, …\n$ CVDeathRate         &lt;dbl&gt; 229.7, 154.1, 138.8, 223.2, 145.6, 128.4, 147.8, 1…\n$ DrugDeathRate       &lt;dbl&gt; 15.7, 16.0, 19.0, 13.8, 11.3, 15.4, 22.1, 22.0, 16…\n$ MotorDeathRate      &lt;dbl&gt; 17.5, 8.8, 13.1, 17.8, 8.1, 10.0, 7.4, 13.3, 14.5,…\n$ CancerDeathRate     &lt;dbl&gt; 175.6, 159.8, 141.3, 185.4, 142.8, 134.4, 146.2, 1…\n$ Obesity             &lt;dbl&gt; 35.7, 31.4, 29.0, 35.7, 25.0, 22.3, 26.0, 30.7, 27…\n$ Smoking             &lt;dbl&gt; 21.5, 19.0, 14.7, 23.6, 11.0, 15.6, 13.4, 17.7, 15…\n$ Exercise            &lt;dbl&gt; 45.4, 55.3, 51.9, 41.2, 56.3, 60.4, 50.9, 49.7, 50…\n$ Seatbelt            &lt;dbl&gt; 95.7, 88.4, 87.2, 74.4, 97.1, 82.4, 85.1, 91.9, 88…\n$ FluVaccination      &lt;dbl&gt; 43.9, 39.1, 41.8, 46.2, 48.0, 49.9, 52.7, 51.2, 43…\n$ ChildVaccination    &lt;dbl&gt; 70.6, 66.3, 72.3, 66.6, 75.0, 75.4, 80.6, 79.3, 66…\n$ Under18             &lt;dbl&gt; 22.8, 25.3, 24.1, 23.8, 23.6, 23.3, 21.6, 21.8, 20…\n$ Over65              &lt;dbl&gt; 15.3, 9.4, 15.9, 15.7, 12.9, 12.7, 15.5, 16.4, 19.…\n\nggplot(data = cdc, mapping = aes(x = Seatbelt)) + \n  geom_histogram(bins = 5) +\n  ggtitle(\"Histogram of percent of adults in each US state who wear seatbelts\") +\n  xlab(\"Percent\") +\n  ylab(\"Count\")\n\n\n\n\nThe distribution looks nearly normally distributed, with some left skew.\n\n\nExercise 16:\nCreate side-by-side boxplots examining the distribution of infant mortality rate by HDI.

First, we need to install R, which can be downloaded here (see screenshot below).\n\nNext, install RStudio Desktop, which can be downloaded here (see screenshot below)."

    "text": "First Steps in RStudio\nWith R and RStudio installed, we’ll begin by exploring RStudio: the interface, reading in data, and basic commands. Upon opening RStudio, you should see something similar to the window below:\n\nThe console is the panel on the left side, and is where users can type commands and see immediate output. Let’s try it out! Type the following code into the console:\n\n3 + 5\n\nYou should get output that looks like\n\n\n[1] 8\n\n\n(For now, ignore the [1]). By typing in 3+5, we got the expected answer, 8. We can see that R can be used as a calculator directly in the console. Try some other commands that use R as a calculator. For instance, 3*25, exp(2), or (10+5^2)/sqrt(40). Of course, R is not simply a calculator; other commands may also be entered here.\nTo illustrate, let’s load a dataset. Enter the following command into the console (you can directly copy/paste it, but make sure everything is exactly as below):\n\ncdc &lt;- read.csv(\"https://karamccor.github.io/b6002/labs/data/cdc_cleaned.csv\")\n\nWe’ve just loaded a dataset named cdc. These data come primarily from the Sortable Risk Factors and Health Indicators dataset from the CDC, which comprises demographic and health indices compiled from various federal sources. This dataset is now part of our environment, which is displayed on the top half and right side of the RStudio window.\n\nThe environment contains all objects in the current working space. These objects could be variables, lists of variables, or even entire datasets.\nIn the same location as the environment tab, the **history tab displays all commands used during the current session (don’t worry about the connections tab for now).\nFinally, the bottom half of the right-hand panel shows information regarding files on your hard drive, installed packages, output such as plots, and help files or other documents.\n\nComing back to the dataset we loaded in, we can see that it is named cdc. We can take a look at this dataset in a spreadsheet-like window by clicking on cdc in the Environment tab to the right, or by running the following code in the console:\n\nView(cdc)\n\nNote that other objects may be added to the environment, either from external data sources from the internet as in today’s example, datasets downloaded to your computer, or even as created as manipulations of existing datasets."

    "text": "R Markdown and reproducible research\nR Markdown is a system that may be used to create easy-to-write, attractive reports, presentations, or webpages that also serve as reproducible records of the data analysis. These reports have the desirable property of being able to not only display written narratives and figures, but also include any R code and the outputs from these code snippets.\nOne of the biggest strengths of R Markdown is that everything is in one place, and that other users should be able to reproduce your results exactly, if they have your R Markdown document and datasets - the analysis is run from the beginning each time you render the document. As well, formatting is easy! Luckily, RStudio already comes with R Markdown support, so there is nothing additional to install.\nEvery homework assignment and lab in this class will be written in R Markdown, with a template provided for you to use. This lab’s template can be downloaded by typing in the following code:\n\n# download.file(\"https://karamccor.github.io/b6002/labs/lab-01-template.Rmd\", destfile=\"lab-01.Rmd\")\n\nYou should now see the new file lab-01.qmd under the Files tab in the bottom-right hand side of your RStudio window. Click on lab-01.qmd in this window in order to open it up – it is the template for use in this lab!\nFirst, put your name in the space at the top where it says “YOUR NAME GOES HERE”.\nFill in answers in the spaces provided: text narrative should be typed directly in the document and any included R code should be typed inside “chunks,” or sections defined by three backticks (the little mark on the same key as the tilde). See the template for more instructions, or ask your TA.\nAn important thing to note is that the workspace of the RMarkdown document is separate from the console – this means that you must load any packages inside of R chunks if you want to use functions contained in them. In the template for this lab, this has been done already, but in the future you may have to do it yourself.\nIn order to turn this template into a shareable document, Render the quarto template into an HTML document by pressing the Render button at the top of the document (it is a large blue arrow facing the right). You should see the template rendered as an .html file!"

    "text": "The tidyverse\n\nAs mentioned previously, one of the biggest strengths of R is its large userbase who have contributed user-written functions to R via packages. R packages are “add-ons” to the basic functions available in R (think of them as apps on a phone).\nThe tidyverse is a collection of packages designed around a common grammar and data structure. Some packages in the tidyverse that we will be using throughout this semester will be ggplot2, used for creating graphics and figures, and dplyr and tidyr, used for data manipulation and wrangling.\n\nFirst, install the tidyverse package by running the following code in your R Studio console:\n\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n\nAfter installing the tidyverse package, you never have to install it again – all that is needed to use functions from the tidyverse is to load the package once per R session using the following code:\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.1     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.3     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\n\nRemember that the console and the R Markdown document have different workspaces. If you load the tidyverse package in your console, it won’t be loaded into the workspace for the Quarto document. In the lab template, code for loading the tidyverse has already been provided. However, note that you must have the package installed first."

The variables in this dataset are as follows:\n\nState, the name of the state\nRegion, the US Census region that each state belongs to\nHDI, the Human Development Index of each state in 2017, categorized into whether they are among the top ten, the bottom ten, or the middle\nInfantMortalityRate: infant mortality rate per 100,000\nCVDeathRate: death rate per 100,000 due to cardiovasulcar causes\nDrugDeathRate: death rate per 100,000 due to drug-related causes (ODs, etc.)\nMotorDeathRate: death rate per 100,000 due to motor vehicle-related causes\nCancerDeathRate: death rate per 100,000 due to cancer\nObesity: % of adults who are obese\nSmoking: % of adults who smoked at least one cigarette in the past month\nExercise: % of adults who participated in at least 2.5 hours of aerobic activity per week\nSeatbelt: % of adults to regularly wear their seat belt\nFluVaccination: % of adults who received a flu vaccine\nChildVaccination: % of children who aged 19-35 months who have received the DTaP, polio, MMR, Hib, hepatitis B, varicella and PCV vaccines\nUnder18: % of residents under age 18\nOver65: % of residents over age 65\n\nLet’s begin with a very simple plot. Run the following code in the console:\n\nggplot(data = cdc, mapping = aes(x = Exercise, y = Obesity)) + \n  geom_point()\n\nWe just created our first plot in R! Let’s break down what each of these components is. ggplot() is the function that tells R to make a plot. We are plotting data from the cdc dataset, with Exercise on the x-axis and Obesity on the y-axis. Adding (+) the geom_point() in a new layer (separated on a new line for clarity) tells R specifically to create a scatterplot.\nDoes there appear to be a relationship between the percentage of adults in a state who participate in at least 2.5 hours of aerobic exercise a week and the percentage of adults in that state who are obese? If so, what is this relationship?\nNow run the following code:\n\nggplot(data = cdc, mapping = aes(x = Exercise,y = Obesity,color = HDI, shape = HDI)) + \n  geom_point()\n\nHow does this code differ from the previous snippet? What changes in the scatterplot does this change correspond to?\nFinally, run the following code, which should result in the plot below. Pay attention to how we’ve added new layers onto our base plot.\n\nggplot(data = cdc, mapping = aes(x = Exercise, y = Obesity, color = HDI, size = CVDeathRate)) + \n  geom_point() +\n  labs(title = \"Aerobic Activity vs. Obesity by State HDI\", \n       subtitle = \"Faceted by Region\", \n       x = \"Adequate aerobic activity (%)\", y = \"Obesity (%)\") + \n  facet_grid(.~Region) +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\nAgain, how does this code differ from the previous plot, and what changes in the plot itself correspond to the additional code?"
