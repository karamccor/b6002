    "text": "BIOS 600 Fall 2024\n\n\nDue: Friday, August 23 at 11:59p\n\n\nName: YOUR NAME GOES HERE\n\n\n\nExercise 1:\nThis study would be considered observational rather than experimental. In an observational study, researchers observe and measure outcomes without manipulating the variables or assigning participants to different conditions. In this case, the researchers observed the eating behaviors and caloric intake of patients with different types of dementia without assigning them to any specific group or intervening in their behavior. The different patient types (without dementia, with AD, semantic dementia, and bvFTD) were pre-existing, and the researchers simply observed the outcomes.\n\n\nExercise 2:\nAround 750 calories. This is based on the center line in the box.\n\n\nExercise 3:\nPatients with behavioral-variant frontal temporal dementia (bvFTD) had the largest IQR. You can see this in the boxplot since the box is the largest.\n\nIQR: about 1600 - 1000 = 600 calories\nfirst quartile: 1000 calories\nthird quartile: about 1600 calories\n\nSide note about how to read boxplots: The distance between Q3 and Q1 is known as the interquartile range (IQR) and plays a major part in how long the whiskers extending from the box are. Each whisker extends to the furthest data point in each wing that is within 1.5 times the IQR. Any data point further than that distance is considered an outlier, and is marked with a dot.\n\n\nExercise 4:\nRight-skewed, because the top whisker extends much farther than the lower whisker, indicating that most of the values are centered around a lower value.\n\n\nExercise 5:\nLower HDIs are associated with higher prevalence of MSVI (indicated by the downward pattern of the points in the scatterplot).\n\n\nExercise 6:\nNigeria has the lowest HDI (about 0.5).\n\n\nExercise 7:\nIndia has higher prevelance of MSVI than might be expected given its HDI. We can tell because the point for India is so much higher (on the y-axis, aka the MSVI axis) than the general trend of the points.\n\n\nExercise 8:\nThis is reasonable, there is a quite clear downward trend between HDI and MSVI.\n\n\nExercise 9:\n\nage: continuous\nrace: nominal\nbody-mass index: continuous\neosinophil count: continuous\n\n\n\nExercise 10:\nWith an experimental study, researchers can make causal statements about the results. There’s more control over confounding variables, and experimental studies can be easily replicated because the conditions are controlled or standardized.\n\n\nExercise 11:\nThe authors could make a grouped box-plot. One box per group.\n\n\nExercise 12:\nA scatterplot would be useful.\n\n\nExercise 13:\nThey could color the points according to the treatment group.\n\n\nExercise 14:\nThe probability that a randomly selected individual is assigned to placebo: 407/1204\n\n\nExercise 15:\nThe probability that a randomly selected individual is male:\n(138 + 124 + 146) /1204 = 408/1204\n\n\nExercise 16:\np(placebo) + p(male) - p(placebo and male) 407/1204 + 408/1204 - 138/1204 = 677/1204\n\n\nExercise 17:\nPlacebo and male\n138/1204\n\n\nExercise 18:\nAsian or not assigned to placebo\np(asian) + p(not placebo) - p(asian and not placebo)\n(50+54+50)/1204 + (399+398)/1204 - (54+50)/1204 = 847/1204\n\n\nExercise 19:\nThe formula to find the probability that an individual is white or male:\np(white) + p(male) - p(white and male)\nWe have p(white) and p(male) but we need p(white and male).\n\n\nExercise 20:\n\nScope: Reproducibility is more about verifying the correctness of the original analysis, while replicability is about testing the robustness of the findings across different settings.\nConditions: Reproducibility uses the same data and methods, whereas replicability often involves different data, samples, or methods.\nFocus: Reproducibility focuses on the precision and accuracy of the original study, while replicability focuses on the generalizability and reliability of the results across different scenarios."

In this case, the number of trials (number of mice sampled) is not fixed, because the researcher is interested in continuing until 10 abnormal mice are found. This suggests that the scenario might be more appropriately modeled by a negative binomial distribution, which is used when the number of trials is not fixed, but instead, the experiment continues until a certain number of successes are observed.\n\nIndependence\n\nThe outcome of one trial (whether a mouse develops deficiencies) must be independent of the outcomes of other trials. If the mice are all exposed to the same conditions independently, this assumption could be satisfied. However, if there are interactions or dependencies between the mice (e.g., one mouse’s health affects another), this assumption might be violated.\n\nConstant Probability of Success\n\nThe probability of a mouse developing lung deficiencies (25 out of 100, or 0.25) is assumed to be constant across trials. This assumption might hold if the experimental conditions are consistent, and there is no change in the population or environmental factors that could affect this probability.\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3\nEvaluate whether the assumptions for a Poisson distribution are satisfied.\n\nWithin any interval, k may take on 1, 2, 3, …, infinity.\n\n\nThis does not hold, since there are a fixed number of students in each school.\n\n\nEach event occurs independently, both within the same interval, and between intervals\n\n\nEach case of measles should occur independently of the others. This means that one child developing measles should not directly influence whether another child in a different school district develops measles.\n\n\nThe average rate at which events occur in an interval, λ, is constant\n\n\nThe number of events (measles cases) should be proportional to the size of the population or the area (e.g., the size of the school district).\n\n\nTwo events cannot occur simultaneously\n\nThis is true. The Poisson distribution assumes that events (in this case, children developing measles) occur one at a time, not in clusters. This means that the likelihood of multiple children developing measles in the exact same instant is very low.\n\n\nExercise 4\nThe mean (2) is significantly greater than the variance (0.09). This violates the assumption of the Poisson distribution, where the mean and variance should be approximately equal.\nIt would not be appropriate to use a Poisson distribution to model the number of eggs laid by Adelie penguin breeding pairs because the key assumption that the mean equals the variance is violated. The variance is much smaller than the mean, suggesting that the data might be more consistent and less dispersed than what a Poisson distribution would predict.\n\n\nExercise 5\nWrite your answer to Exercise 5 here.\n\n\nExercise 6\nWrite your answer to Exercise 6 here.\n\n\nExercise 7\nWrite your answer to Exercise 7 here.\n\n\nExercise 8\nWrite your answer to Exercise 8 here.\n\n\nExercise 9\nWrite your answer to Exercise 9 here.\n\n\nExercise 10\nWrite your answer to Exercise 10 here."

This makes sense, because if one sibling has chicken pox, it may be more probable that the other sibling gets chicken pox, since we might assume they are sharing space in a home.\n\n\nExercise 6:\nDo Exercise 6 here. Feel free to write out any numerical calculations you are using, setting them apart using backticks in order to draw attention to them. For instance, (0.1 * 0.2)/(0.4*0.6 + (1-0.4)*0.3). When displaying your final answer, use an R chunk to evaluate the answer:\nWe want to find \\(P(B|A) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}\\)\n\\(P(A) = .5\\) \\(P(B) = .5\\) \\(P(A \\cap B) = .35\\)\nSo we have that the answer is (.35)/(.5).\n\n.35/.5\n\n[1] 0.7\n\n\n\n\nExercise 7:\nWe just calcuated that P(B|A) = 0.70.\n\\(P(B^C | A) = 1 - P(B|A)\\)\nSo, the answer is 1-0.70.\n\n1-0.70\n\n[1] 0.3\n\n\n\n\nExercise 8:\nWe want to find\n\\(P(B | A^C)\\)\nWe know that P(A^C) = 1-P(A) = 1-0.5 = 0.5\nNow, we use the law of total probability.\n\\(P(B) = P(B \\cap A) + P(B \\cap A^C)\\)\nSo we have that \\(0.5 = 0.35 + P(B \\cap A^C)\\) and \\(P(B \\cap A^C) = 0.5 - 0.35 = 0.15\\)\nNow, we apply Bayes’ Rule to find \\(P(B | A^C)\\).\n\\(P(B | A^C) = \\frac{P(B \\cap A^C)}{P(A^C)}\\)\n= 0.15/0.5\n\n0.15/0.5\n\n[1] 0.3\n\n\n\n\nExercise 9:\n\\(S\\) = severe WFNS score \\(B\\) = bad outcome at one year mark\n(10 + 30)/100 = 40/100\n\n40/100\n\n[1] 0.4\n\n\n\n\nExercise 10:\nSensitivity = true positive rate = \\(P(S|B)\\).\nUsing Bayes’ rule, we have \\(P(S|B) = \\frac{P(B|S)P(S)}{P(B)}\\)\nNow,\n\nP(bad outcome | severe score) = 30/40\nP(severe score) = 40/100\nP(bad outcome) = 40/100\n\nSo, \\(P(S|B)\\) = [(30/40)*(40/100)] / (40/100), which simplifies to\n\n30/40\n\n[1] 0.75\n\n\n\n\nExercise 11:\nSpecificity refers to the probability that a patient with a “good outcome” does not have a severe WFNS score. Mathematically, it is the probability that a patient has a non-severe WFNS score given that they have a good outcome: P(Non-Severe WFNS∣Good Outcome)P(Non-Severe WFNS∣Good Outcome)\nSo, we want: \\(P(\\text{non-severe score}| \\text{good outcome} ) = \\frac{P(\\text{good outcome} | \\text{non-severe score})P(\\text{non-severe score})}{P(\\text{good outcome})}\\)\n\nP(good outcome | non-severe score) = 50/60\nP(non-severe score)= 60/100\nP(good outcome) = 60/100\n\nThis simplifies to (50/60)*(60/100)/(60/100) = 50/60\n\n50/60\n\n[1] 0.8333333\n\n\nUsing Bayes’ Rule, we find that the specificity, or the probability that a patient with a good outcome has a non-severe WFNS score, is approximately 0.833, or 83.3%. This indicates that the WFNS score is fairly specific for identifying patients who will have a good outcome.\n\n\nExercise 12:\nTo calculate the Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of “high NDKA” as a diagnostic for bad outcomes, we first need to clarify that NPV is the probability that a patient does not have a bad outcome given that their NDKA level is low (i.e., the test result is negative). Given Information:\n\nSensitivity (True Positive Rate): 20% (P(High NDKA∣Bad Outcome)=0.2P(High NDKA∣Bad Outcome)=0.2)\nSpecificity (True Negative Rate): 90% (P(Low NDKA∣Good Outcome)=0.9P(Low NDKA∣Good Outcome)=0.9)\nPrevalence (P(Bad Outcome)): Not directly given, so we’ll assume it based on earlier data, where the prevalence was 40% (from the initial 100 patients, 40 had a bad outcome).\n\nNegative Predictive Value = P(good outcome | Low NDKA)\nUsing Bayes’ rule, this can be re-written as: [P(low NDKA | good outcome) * P(good outcome)] / P(low NDKA)\nP(low NDKA) = P(low NDKA | good)P(good) + P(low NDKA | bad) P(bad)\n\nP(low NDKA | good) = specificity = 0.9 (given)\nP(low NDKA | bad ) = 1- sensitivity = 1- P(B | A) = 1 - .20 = 0.80\n\nThis is by the law of total probability, which states that P(B|A) + P(B^C | A) = 1\n\nP(good outcome) = 0.60 from the question description\nP(bad outcome) = 0.40 from exercise 9\n\nP(low NDKA) = (0.90)*(0.60)+ (0.80)(0.40) = 0.86\n\n(0.90)*(0.60)+ (0.80)*(0.40)\n\n[1] 0.86\n\n\nThen, the NPV is [P(low NDKA | good)P(good)]/P(low NDKA)\n=\n\n(0.90)*(0.60)/0.86\n\n[1] 0.627907\n\n\nThe negative predictive value (NPV) of using “high NDKA” as a diagnostic for bad outcomes is approximately 0.628, or 62.8%. This means that if a patient has a low NDKA level, there is a 62.8% chance that they will not experience a bad outcome at the one-year mark.\n\n\nExercise 13:\nIf we are willing to accept a false positive rate of at most 10%, that means that we are willing to accept a Specificity as low as 90%, since False Positive Rate = 1 - specificity. The true positive rate is also known as the specificity. So, if we look at 90% on the x-axis, the corresponding specificity (or TPR) on the y-axis is about .35. So, we can attain aboug 35% true positive rate with that stipulation.\nNote: The ROC curve represents the trade-off between sensitivity (TPR) and specificity (related to FPR). Higher TPR values are better, but they usually come at the cost of increasing FPR, depending on the threshold set by the classifier.\n\n\nExercise 14:\nWe would rather use S100\\(\\beta\\), because the sensitivity levels are consistently higher compared to NDKA given a certain level of specificity.\n\n\nExercise 15:\n\ncdc &lt;- read.csv(\"https://karamccor.github.io/b6002/labs/data/cdc_cleaned.csv\")\n\n\n# Loading in tidyverse package...\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\nglimpse(cdc)\n\nRows: 50\nColumns: 17\n$ X                   &lt;int&gt; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15,…\n$ State               &lt;chr&gt; \"Alabama\", \"Alaska\", \"Arizona\", \"Arkansas\", \"Calif…\n$ Region              &lt;chr&gt; \"South\", \"West\", \"West\", \"South\", \"West\", \"West\", …\n$ HDI                 &lt;chr&gt; \"Bottom ten\", \"Middle\", \"Middle\", \"Bottom ten\", \"M…\n$ InfantMortalityRate &lt;dbl&gt; 8.7, 6.7, 6.1, 7.5, 4.3, 4.8, 4.8, 6.7, 6.1, 7.5, …\n$ CVDeathRate         &lt;dbl&gt; 229.7, 154.1, 138.8, 223.2, 145.6, 128.4, 147.8, 1…\n$ DrugDeathRate       &lt;dbl&gt; 15.7, 16.0, 19.0, 13.8, 11.3, 15.4, 22.1, 22.0, 16…\n$ MotorDeathRate      &lt;dbl&gt; 17.5, 8.8, 13.1, 17.8, 8.1, 10.0, 7.4, 13.3, 14.5,…\n$ CancerDeathRate     &lt;dbl&gt; 175.6, 159.8, 141.3, 185.4, 142.8, 134.4, 146.2, 1…\n$ Obesity             &lt;dbl&gt; 35.7, 31.4, 29.0, 35.7, 25.0, 22.3, 26.0, 30.7, 27…\n$ Smoking             &lt;dbl&gt; 21.5, 19.0, 14.7, 23.6, 11.0, 15.6, 13.4, 17.7, 15…\n$ Exercise            &lt;dbl&gt; 45.4, 55.3, 51.9, 41.2, 56.3, 60.4, 50.9, 49.7, 50…\n$ Seatbelt            &lt;dbl&gt; 95.7, 88.4, 87.2, 74.4, 97.1, 82.4, 85.1, 91.9, 88…\n$ FluVaccination      &lt;dbl&gt; 43.9, 39.1, 41.8, 46.2, 48.0, 49.9, 52.7, 51.2, 43…\n$ ChildVaccination    &lt;dbl&gt; 70.6, 66.3, 72.3, 66.6, 75.0, 75.4, 80.6, 79.3, 66…\n$ Under18             &lt;dbl&gt; 22.8, 25.3, 24.1, 23.8, 23.6, 23.3, 21.6, 21.8, 20…\n$ Over65              &lt;dbl&gt; 15.3, 9.4, 15.9, 15.7, 12.9, 12.7, 15.5, 16.4, 19.…\n\nggplot(data = cdc, mapping = aes(x = Seatbelt)) + \n  geom_histogram(bins = 5) +\n  ggtitle(\"Histogram of percent of adults in each US state who wear seatbelts\") +\n  xlab(\"Percent\") +\n  ylab(\"Count\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe distribution looks nearly normally distributed, with some left skew.\n\n\nExercise 16:\nCreate side-by-side boxplots examining the distribution of infant mortality rate by HDI.
